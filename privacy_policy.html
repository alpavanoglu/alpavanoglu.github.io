    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date: [15/08/2024]</strong></p>

    <p>Thank you for using Sips. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our app.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. The only data we collect is anonymous, aggregated data about how you use the app. This data is collected using Firebase Analytics, a service provided by Google.</p>

    <h3>Firebase Analytics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Firebase Analytics automatically collects certain information about your device, your use of the app, and events that occur within the app. This information is collected anonymously and includes:
            <ul>
                <li>Device information (e.g., model, operating system version)</li>
                <li>App usage data (e.g., screen views, session duration)</li>
                <li>Performance data (e.g., crash reports)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>The anonymous data collected via Firebase Analytics is used solely for the purpose of understanding how users interact with our app. This information helps us to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Improve app performance and user experience</li>
        <li>Identify and fix bugs</li>
        <li>Understand user engagement</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We do not share your information with any third parties, except for the data that is shared with Firebase Analytics, as described above. Firebase Analytics may share aggregated, anonymized data with other Google services. For more information on how Google uses data, please refer to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain the anonymous data collected via Firebase Analytics for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy. This data does not include personally identifiable information and cannot be used to identify you.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect personal information, there are no personal data rights applicable. However, you can manage your privacy settings on your device, including opting out of data collection by disabling analytics tracking in the app settings or device settings.</p>

    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the data we collect from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction. However, please note that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any changes, we will notify you by updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.</p>
